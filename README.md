## What I Have Learned

In the process of building the Weather App project, I've gained valuable insights and skills in various areas:

- **API Integration**: Successfully integrated the WeatherAPI into the application, allowing users to retrieve real-time weather data for specific locations

- **Dynamic UI Styling**: Explored techniques to dynamically change the look of the page based on weather data. Implemented features such as background display of weather-related images from the Giphy API

- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Leveraged asynchronous programming concepts, including promises and async/await, to ensure smooth data retrieval and processing. Try/catch block to handle errors

- **Project Deployment on GitHub**: Utilized Git for version control and hosted the project on GitHub, allowing for collaboration and sharing of the Weather App solution


By engaging in this project, I've enhanced my abilities as a developer and deepened my understanding of web development concepts, including API integration, asynchronous programming.
